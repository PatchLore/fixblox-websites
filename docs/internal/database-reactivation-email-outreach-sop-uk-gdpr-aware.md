# Database Reactivation – Email Outreach SOP (UK / GDPR-Aware)

## Purpose

This document outlines the exact step-by-step process FixBlox follows to run database reactivation email campaigns safely, professionally, and in line with UK GDPR / PECR expectations.

This process is mandatory. Do not skip steps.

## 🚫 The Golden Rule (Non-Negotiable)

Never paste client emails into a personal inbox (Gmail / Outlook) and send via BCC.

Reasons:

- Immediate GDPR risk
- No unsubscribe handling
- High chance of spam complaints
- Email domain blacklisting
- Personal liability exposure

All campaigns must be sent through approved software only.

## Step 1: Use the Right Software (“The Engine”)

Bulk or re-engagement email campaigns must be sent using software that automatically handles:

- Unsubscribes
- Compliance headers
- Sending limits
- Delivery reputation

### Preferred Option (Agency-Grade)

GoHighLevel (GHL)

Why:

- Built for agencies
- Email + SMS + calendar booking in one place
- Automation ready
- Full audit trail
- Scales into managed services later

### Alternative (Lower Cost / Starter)

Brevo (Sendinblue) or Systeme.io

Why:

- GDPR compliant
- EU servers (better UK deliverability)
- Free or low-cost tiers
- Automatic unsubscribe handling

⚠️ Do not use tools without unsubscribe functionality.

## Step 2: “Wash” the List (Critical Protection Step)

Before uploading any client data, the list must be cleaned.

### Process

- Request the list from the client as a CSV or Excel file
- Upload the list to an email verification tool:
  - NeverBounce
  - MillionVerifier
  - (Cost: approx £5 per 1,000 emails)

### Outcome

The tool will remove:

- Invalid emails
- Hard bounces
- Spam traps
- Syntax errors

### Rule

➡️ Upload only the CLEAN list into GHL / Brevo  
➡️ Never upload raw, unchecked data

This protects:

- Delivery rates
- Sender reputation
- Future campaigns

## Step 3: Enable “Drip Mode” (Never Blast)

Bulk blasting triggers spam filters.

### Required Settings

- Enable Drip / Batch Sending
- Send 20–50 emails per hour
- Start during business hours (UK time)

### Why This Matters

- Mimics natural human sending behaviour
- Prevents Gmail / Outlook throttling
- Keeps emails landing in inbox (not spam)

🚫 Never send all emails at once  
🚫 Never launch campaigns on Friday afternoon

## Step 4: Mandatory Legal Footer (GDPR / PECR)

Every email must include:

- Client’s business name
- Client’s physical address (not FixBlox’s)
- Automatic unsubscribe link
- Reason for contact:
  - “You are receiving this email because you are a past customer of [Client Name].”

The sending software will usually insert unsubscribe links automatically — confirm this before sending.

## Step 5: Two-Stage Email Strategy (Booking-Focused)

Do not send a single hard-sell email.

Use a two-stage approach to:

- Re-permission the list
- Identify interested contacts
- Minimise complaints

### Email 1 — “Soft Touch” (Day 1)

Goal:  
Clean the list and surface warm interest without selling.

Subject:  
Quick question for [First Name]

Body:

Hi [Name],

We’re just updating our patient records at [Clinic Name].  
It’s been a while since we last saw you — are you still based in Warlingham?

We have a few appointments opening up next week and wanted to give our past patients first refusal.

Let me know if you’d like the details.

Thanks,  
[Clinic Name]

### Email 2 — “Offer” (Day 3)

Send only to contacts who did NOT unsubscribe

Subject:  
Priority access for [First Name]

Body:

Hi [Name],

Just following up on my last note.

We’re running a Winter Teeth Whitening offer this month.  
Normally £350, but for returning patients we’re offering it at £250.

I have 3 slots available next Thursday.  
Would you like to grab one?

Book here: [Calendar Link]

Best,  
[Clinic Name]
